# flickr-maps
FlickrMapshup aims to provide a fun, easy way to find images from around the world. This mashup combines the Google Maps JS API with the Flickr API, to allow users to search for and view photos from Flickr and display their geotagged locations onto an interactive map. 
This was a project done as part of Cloud Computing in my 3rd year of uni. This was my first experience with Javascript, Web Applications and Cloud Computing (AWS).
A full report showcasing the use cases, technical breakdown, testing and user guide is provided.
To get the code to run locally, simply download and call "npm install" and "npm start" and then access via localhost. A similar process can be used to start up the program using an EC2 instance and the Dockerfile.
